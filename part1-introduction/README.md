## Introduction to Git and Github

### So what is Git and what is GitHub?

So what is Git and what is GitHub? Put simply, **Git** is a version control system that lets you manage you code in a very convenient and easy way. **GitHub** is a cloud-based host that lets you store and manage projects that use Git.

### How do I get started?

**Note:** All code snippets in this tutorial are assuming you are working from a UNIX based system (Mac/Linux). If you're working from a Windows computer, the concepts will still apply, but the ways that they are implemented may be different. 

The first step to get started is to install Git on your computer. If you're on a Mac, Git should come preloaded. To check, type `git` in your shell and usage information, along with common Git commands, should print. If you get an error or a response like `git: command not found`, you can install it [from the Git documentation site](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

**Note:** If you are a Mac user, you might need XCode's [Command Line Package](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html) which allows for command line development in OSX. *Note: you do not need XCode to get these developer tools.* In order to install the package, run `xcode-select --install` in your terminal. If you get an error, you can troubleshoot and learn more about the package [here](https://developer.apple.com/opensource/).

Once you have Git installed on your computer, we can start your journey to becoming a contributor! Let's go to the next section to continue.
