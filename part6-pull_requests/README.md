## Opening pull requests

The final step in making sure that your changes make it into the project is opening up a **pull request**. Pull requests compare your branch to the master branch of the repository, allow for your code to be reviewed and any necessary changes to be made, and handle branch merging automatically. The normal process of submitting code via pull requests looks like this:
 1. You push your contributions to your personal branch
 2. You open up a pull request between your branch and the master branch
 3. You add reviewers to your code to check it before merging. Some projects, like the [Quantum Programming API](https://github.com/yaleqc/quantum-programming-api/) do this automatially.
 4. Reviewers either approve or request changes to your code.
 5. Changes get resolved eventually and then you merge your changes into the master branch!
